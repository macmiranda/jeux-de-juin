Lieutenant Dunbar wasn't really swallowed. But that was the first word that stuck in his head.

Everything was immense. The great, cloudless sky. The rolling ocean of grass. Nothing else,
no matter where he put his eyes. No road. No trace of ruts for the big wagon to follow. Just sheer,
empty space.

He was adrift. It made his heart jump in a strange and profound way.
